Total Gross Profit: USD {totalgrossprofit:,}
Operating Revenue: USD {operatingrevenue:,}
Gross Profit Margin: {gross_profit:,}%```

*Operating Profit Margin*
```
Total Operating Income: USD {totaloperatingincome:,}
Operating Revenue: USD {operatingrevenue:,}
Operating Profit Margin: {operating_profit:,}%
```
Operating margin measures how much profit a company makes on a dollar of sales, after paying for variable costs of production such as wages and raw materials, but before paying interest or tax.

*Net Profit Margin*
```
Net Income: USD {netincome:,}
Operating Revenue: USD {operatingrevenue:,}
Net Profit Margin: {net_profit}%
```
Net profit margin is the percentage of revenue left after all expenses have been deducted from sales.  The measurement reveals the amount of profit that a business can extract from its total sales.

*Return on Capital Employed*
```
Total Operating Income: USD {totaloperatingincome:,}
Total Non-Current Liabilities: USD {totalnoncurrentliabilities:,}
Total Equity: USD {totalequity:,}
Retained Earnings: USD {retainedearnings:,}
Return on Capital Employed: {return_on_capital_employed:,}%
```
Return on Capital Employed measures how efficiently a company can generate profits from its capital employed by comparing net operating profit to capital employed, it shows how many dollars in profits each dollar of capital employed generates.

*Return on Equity*
```
Net Income: USD {netincome:,}
Total Equity: USD {totalequity:,}
Return on Equity: {return_on_equity:,}%
```
Measures the ability of a firm to generate profits from its shareholders investments in the company. In other words, the return on equity ratio shows how much profit each dollar of common stockholders' equity generates.

*Return on Assets*
```
Total Operating Income: USD {totaloperatingincome:,}
Total Assets: USD {totalassets:,}
Return on Assets: {return_on_assets}%
```
ROA is an indicator of how profitable a company is relative to its total assets. It reveals how efficient a company's management is at using its assets to generate earnings.

*Current Ratio*
```
Total Current Assets: USD {totalcurrentassets:,}
Total Current Liabilities: USD {totalcurrentliabilities:,}
Current Ratio: {currentratio}:1
```
Current ratio measures a company\'s ability to pay short-term and long-term obligations. 
*Gearing Ratio*
```
Total Non-Current Liabilities: USD {totalnoncurrentliabilities:,}
Total Equity: USD {totalequity:,}
Gearing Ratio: {gearingratio}%
```
